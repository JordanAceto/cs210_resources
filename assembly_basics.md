## Some useful links for getting a feel for assembly

#### There are not super organized and may not all cover the actual branch of assembly we will be studying. The idea is to get an intuitive big picture overview of what assembly actually is:

- https://godbolt.org/ this is the single most useful tool. it lets you type in C or C++ code and immediately spits out assembly code. you can set different compilers and compiler flags
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my39Gpt6bvY this guy goes into how C maps to assembly. he constantly uses the compiler explorer above. super useful series in general if you like C++.

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1ung0wil9Y&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63VIBQVWguXxZZi0566y7Wf&index=4 MIT lecture from 6.172, nice broad-strokes assembly primer.
- http://www.securitytube.net/groups?operation=view&groupId=5 this is a series on assembly for linux. if you go through the first few videos you can write a nice hello world in assembly and get a feel for how variables work.
