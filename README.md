## This is a repository for dumping miscellaneous resources for the upcoming TC3 Computer Architecture course CSCI210.

### Various files will be added as I go.

#### The general order to explore things:
- binary_number_system_concepts.md
- low_level_concepts.md
- bit_hacks
- assembly_basics.md

#### You don't need to exhaustively go through everything in each section. The idea is just to start getting a feel for the material that will be covered in the course, so that we can hit the ground running when the semester starts.
